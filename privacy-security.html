                        <p>SIP controls the User access to information based on roles assigned to each user. When Site User is registered in SIP as an Investigator or a Clinical Research User prior to participating in a study, they have access to only the below data in SIP:</p>
                        <p class="subhead">2. Is SIP compliant with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements?</p>
                        <p>Yes, GCP requirements are included in our User Requirements, and the system is tested to ensure that these requirements are met during each release.</p>

                        <p>Once the site user is associated with a Study then permissions are further granted to access the Study Workspace data and the Study Site data for which user acts as site staff. Based upon the site staff role assigned, the permissions are extended to view Study Reports in the system. If a Site User is removed from a site staff role permission to view the Study workspace is revoked, terminating access to the study data.</p> 

                        <p>These permissions for each role assigned to a Site User in SIP are defined in a comprehensive “Role based” matrix that defines the access for each Sponsor and Site User role at module/business function level.</p>

                        <p>The SIP Role Matrix is updated with each SIP release, and the system is tested to ensure thatusers are being granted access to the right information based on their role. Key changes in role-based access are communicated to users as needed.</p>

                        <p>Any changes in data access which affects user privacy would be communicated to users prior to the release of this information.</p>

                        <p class="subhead">2. The terms of use states that SIP cannot be guaranteed to be 100% free of malware. Why?</p>
                        <p>The vendor is unable to provide a 100% guarantee because, unfortunately, bad actors continue on the web and it is impossible to guarantee complete immunity from these attacks. However, security measures are in place to protect the SIP. For more information on those measures, please see below.</p>


                        <p class="subhead">3. What can I do to help make sure my data is secure?</p>
                        <p>All SIP Users are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their own passwords and for not sharing their login credentials with others in their staff. Each Site User should have their own account and delegation of work should be formally delegated in the system rather than allowing multiple individuals on the staff to use a single account. This is critical from a security perspective.</p>

                        <p>If an individual believes that their account has been compromised and is no longer secure, contact the <a href="mailto:SIPHelp@cognizant.com">SIP Help Desk</a> at SIPHelp@cognizant.com immediately.</p>

                        <p class="subhead">4. What security measures are in place to avoid potential “misuse” of the data in SIP?</p>
                        <p>SIP has the following security measures in place to ensure the security of your information:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Infrastructure</b> - SIP is hosted in secured Data Centers within a De-Militarized Zone (DMZ). This is basically achieved using Firewalls and other tools which provide the monitoring and scanning abilities. Any events triggered by the tools are sent to the support desk who handle them based on well-defined SOPs.
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><b>Firewall</b> - The firewalls and associated Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) module provide network security by preventing unwanted or malicious network traffic and in directing legitimate network traffic correctly according to its source and destination. There are IPS modules associated with every firewall instance which are configured to scan the DMZ traffic. Firewalls also provide the SSL VPN functionality for remote management of the infrastructure. SSL VPN solution is integrated with RSA 2-Factor authentication to provide more security. RSA uses a combination of 2 factors (PIN+Token code) in order to validate the user authentication.</li>

                                    <li><b>Anti-Virus</b> – Anti Virus Tool used here combines anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall, and intrusion prevention technologies to stop and remove malicious software. It also extends coverage to new security risks and reduces the cost of responding to outbreaks with the industry’s lowest impact on system performance.</li>
                                    <li><b>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</b> – SIP uses an SIEM software that collects and aggregates log data generated throughout the infrastructure, from host systems and applications to network and security devices such as firewalls and antivirus filters.</li>

                                    <li><b>Encryption</b> - The Platform uses industry-standard 128 bit "Secure Socket Layer" encryption to protect your personal information when you access secure areas of the Platform.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm used for column level encryption and decryption of PII data.</li>
                                            <li>Oracle standard package DBMS_CRYPTO with AES128 algorithm is used for storing the Personally Identifiably Information (PII data) in encrypted format.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please note that no transmission over the Internet or any public network can ever be guaranteed 100% secure, and we cannot accept liability for any security compromise to transmissions over such networks.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Access Control</b> - SIP application maintains the access control information of individual user to manage important data sets like Study, Site, Roles etc.
                                    
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Authorization Checks</b> - The SIP application verifies if the logged in user is authorized to access the resource or data set the user has requested. For example, when users click on a specific Study or Study Site, the application performs an authorization check to ensure that the user has valid access to that Study and/or Study Site before providing access to the information in the database.</li>

                                    <li><b>Database Queries</b> – The system is designed using Database Queries which ensure that only accessible data is returned for a given user and organization.</li>
                                    <li><b>Single Sign-On</b> – The Sponsor (also referred to sometimes as Member Company) users logged in using SSO by which the application receives the organization information to which user is associated.</li>

                                    <li><b>Exostar</b> - Exostar maintains the Site User credentials and performs Site User authentication. For additional details on the security of our SSO provider please contact Exostar at <a href="mailto:customersupport@exostar.com">customersupport@exostar.com</a>.</li>
                                     
                                 </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Sponsor Level Security</b> - The Sponsors and their service providers are also responsible for taking appropriate technical, administrative and organizational measures to ensure that personally-identifiable information (PII) is protected against accidental or unlawful destruction and against accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, as well as against all other unlawful forms of processing. For additional information on Sponsor security of information, please contact each sponsor directly. Sponsor Contacts are available through the SIP Help Desk.</li>

                             <li><b>Anti-Virus Engine on the platform</b> - SIP uses an Anti-Virus Engine, which kicks off whenever any file upload request reaches the Portal Server. If the file being uploaded happens to be a virus infected file, then the scanner throws an exception which is caught to display the custom message on the SIP screen.</li>


                             <li><b>Periodic Vulnerability Assessments</b> - SIP development and support teams are involved in periodic assessments of the application code as well as the infrastructure. The team performs regular assessment of code.</li>
